# KnowNow - Specialized GRE learning software (MVP)
Leveraging generative AI in the education sector, particularly in the context of higher education and competitive exams. On the web.

## Reasons
- Very expensive study material
    - Textbooks
    - Study Guides
- Unpersonalized training
    - One-fits-all method
    - No tutoring 
- Broad number of subjects, hard to keep track, know where/when to improve
- GRE Agent
    - Pros: Wide user base; includes both verbal and quantitative sections, offering a broader range of content.
    - Cons: User-base is decreasing since universities are starting to waive the GRE option.
      
## Features
- Free trial (Anonymous feature. No need to log in. Learn right away. Keep track of users and data.)
    - A free trial would allow users to try out the platform and its features before committing to a purchase. Also, a incredibly good thing to keep track of when applying to YC
- Personalized experience only after log in
    - Do they know their weaknesses and strenghts beforehand? If not, start from 50% everything
        - What are possible categories to measure?        
    - Constant Agent Filters (formulate type of answer)
        - Example: 'be concise', 'explaing reasoning', etc.
    - Be adaptive
- Mock Tests
    - Keep track of time, performance, and update weaknesses/strenghts (on an interactive bar. Why? Addicting)
    - Automated grading and feedback
    - Divide by category
- Flashcard generator
    - This MVP will be easier to develop, and it also tests the core functionality of your generative AI â€“ the ability to create meaningful, valuable content from existing material.
    - User-Open report function in case flashcard is faulty. Hence, we are a new company. Only gets better from there
- Comprehensive Lecture Summarizer
    - Input video lectures, transcribe them, and generate concise, easy-to-understand summaries, key points, and flashcards for revision.
    - Youtube? See how it is being done - Ortus AI does something similar
- Question -> Answer pipeline
    - Can be transferred as OCR, but this is MVP.
    - Make a harder iteration of a questions
    - Always provide answers with walkthrough option (They want to learn, not cheat)
        - Provide more resources and exercises to help them improve.
        - Rich, diverse, and dynamic array of learning content, generated by the AI.
- Text-to-Speech
    This feature would make the tool more accessible, allowing users to consume study materials audibly (while driving), and also aid individuals with incapabilities.
- Subject categories - Keep track of "subject confidence"
    -  Analytical Writing measure of the GRE General Test
        - Providing structure templates for different types of essays, generating thesis statements, or even offering grammar and style suggestions.

# MOTIVATION: YC Office Hours 
- CLEAR VISION
    Personalized, adaptive learning resources, real-time assessment, and feedback, or it could be an all-in-one tool that helps users prepare for competitive examinations more efficiently and effectively.

- KNOW YOUR USER
    Users would primarily be students preparing for competitive exams. Dig deeper into understanding their pain points, learning methods, and what they value most in a study aid. For example, are they looking for convenience, depth of resources, adaptive learning experiences, affordability, or a mix of all?

- REVENUE VS. SCALABILITY
    Focus on creating a unique value proposition and a superior user experience. What can our generative AI tool offer that existing solutions don't?
    
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR COMPETITION
