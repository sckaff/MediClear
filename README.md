- CLEAR VISION
    Personalized, adaptive learning resources, real-time assessment, and feedback, or it could be an all-in-one tool that helps users prepare for competitive examinations more efficiently and effectively.

- KNOW YOUR USER
    Users would primarily be students preparing for competitive exams. Dig deeper into understanding their pain points, learning methods, and what they value most in a study aid. For example, are they looking for convenience, depth of resources, adaptive learning experiences, affordability, or a mix of all?

- REVENUE VS. SCALABILITY
    Focus on creating a unique value proposition and a superior user experience. What can our generative AI tool offer that existing solutions don't?

- DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR COMPETITION

# The Idea - Generative AI for education
Leveraging generative AI in the education sector, particularly in the context of higher education and competitive exams. 

Examples:
- Very expensive study material for dental school ($500)
    - Textbooks
    - Study Guides
    - Entrance Exams
    - Plug all information, we give
        - Flash cards
        - New material
        - Make a harder version of this question
        - Walkthrough

- OCR
    Could be used to digitize textbooks and other physical resources, making it easier to feed this data into the AI and create a comprehensive digital study library.

- Struggle with a specific concept
    Provide more resources and exercises to help them improve.

- Text-to-Speech
    This feature would make the tool more accessible, allowing users to consume study materials audibly, and also aid individuals with incapabilities.

## First Viable Product
### Features
- Language 
    With its broad and global appeal, this could be a good area to start with. The AI could generate language learning exercises, **flashcards**, and tests.
- Free trial
    A free trial would allow users to try out the platform and its features before committing to a purchase. Also, a incredibly good thing to keep track of when applying to YC
- Personalized experience
    - Aid the individual's weaknesses, prioritize it.
    - Show individual's strength
    - Adaptive assessment
- Content creation
    Rich, diverse, and dynamic array of learning content, generated by the AI.
- Automated grading and feedback
    Providing structure templates for different types of essays, generating thesis statements, or even offering grammar and style suggestions.
- Flashcard generator
    This MVP will be easier to develop, and it also tests the core functionality of your generative AI â€“ the ability to create meaningful, valuable content from existing material.
- Compregensive Lecture Summarizer
    Input video lectures, transcribe them, and generate concise, easy-to-understand summaries, key points, and flashcards for revision.

## Main Idea for the first MVP
- GRE Agent
    - Pros: Wide user base; includes both verbal and quantitative sections, offering a broader range of content.

    - Cons: Highly competitive.

- LSAT Agent
    - Pros: High demand for quality study material; focuses on logic and reasoning, which might be easier for an AI to generate content for.

    - Cons: Smaller user base than GRE. Content may be challenging to generate due to the critical thinking and reasoning focus.

- MCAT Agent
    - Pros: Expensive study material makes a lower-cost AI-generated alternative attractive; high volume of content to work with (covering multiple science disciplines).

    - Cons: Highly specialized content.

Sckaff opinion: GRE.
